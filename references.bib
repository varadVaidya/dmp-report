 abstract = {The visual information on a scatterplot can be greatly enhanced, with little additional cost, by computing and plotting smoothed points. Robust locally weighted regression is a method for smoothing a scatterplot, (xi, yi), i = 1, ⋯, n, in which the fitted value at xk is the value of a polynomial fit to the data using weighted least squares, where the weight for (xi, yi) is large if xi is close to xk and small if it is not. A robust fitting procedure is used that guards against deviant points distorting the smoothed points. Visual, computational, and statistical issues of robust locally weighted regression are discussed. Several examples, including data on lead intoxication, are used to illustrate the methodology.},

  abstract={Obstacle avoidance for Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) is still a challenging problem. In our previous work, we proposed a framework for obstacle avoidance based on superquadric potential functions to represent volumes. In this work, we extend our previous work to include the velocity of the system in the definition of the potential. Our formulations guarantee smoother behavior with respect to state-of-the-art point-like methods. Moreover, our new formulation allows obtaining a smoother behavior in proximity of the obstacle than when using a static (i.e. velocity independent) potential. We validate our framework for obstacle avoidance in a simulated multi-robot scenario and with different real robots: a pick-and-place task for an industrial manipulator and a surgical robot to show scalability; and navigation with a mobile robot in a dynamic environment.},
